Minimal EDN-driven graph visualization. Describe nodes, directed edges, and
nested grouping boxes in an EDN file; view it as an auto-layouted canvas diagram
that live-reloads while you edit the file.

[![50-second tour: live reload, inspecting, editing in place, editing a linked markdown doc, state marks, themes, pairs, following a ref, comparing a fork, exporting](docs/assets/demo.gif)](docs/assets/demo.mp4)

## Install

Linux, with [babashka](https://babashka.org/) 1.12 or newer, curl and tar:

    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sstoehrm/simpleviz/main/install.sh | bash

This installs into `~/.simpleviz` and puts a launcher in `~/.local/bin`.
`simpleviz update` fetches the latest release.

With [bbin](https://github.com/babashka/bbin) (tested on Linux), the same
command installs and updates the release jar:

    bbin install https://github.com/sstoehrm/simpleviz/releases/latest/download/simpleviz.jar

Both write `~/.local/bin/simpleviz`, so use one or the other.
`simpleviz clean-all`, which stops every running server, needs the
install.sh launcher on Linux. CI tests only the last two babashka minor
releases (currently 1.12 and 1.13).

Without an installer, unpack a tarball from the
[releases page](https://github.com/sstoehrm/simpleviz/releases) and run
`bb serve examples/demo.edn` inside it (port 7373; `--port N` changes it).

## Usage

    simpleviz demo                             # copy the examples to a temp folder, serve them
    simpleviz my-arch.edn                      # serve a graph on a free port 7370-7469
    simpleviz init my-arch.edn                 # write a starter file
    simpleviz fork my-arch.edn next            # copy to my-arch-next.edn, plus every file it refs
    simpleviz my-arch.edn next                 # compare my-arch.edn → my-arch-next.edn
    simpleviz promote my-arch.edn next         # make the forks the new originals
    simpleviz export my-arch.edn my-arch.png   # the ⇩ export from the terminal (needs Chrome or Chromium)

`--no-open` prints the URL without opening a browser; `simpleviz --help` lists the rest. Edit the file and the page follows. You
can also edit in the page: click an element to inspect and change its
attributes, and use the toolbar at the bottom to add, connect, group and
delete. ⇩ exports a PNG or an SVG, both with the source embedded; simpleviz
serves either like an EDN file. Press `?` in
the page for controls and shortcuts.

The [guide](https://github.com/sstoehrm/simpleviz/blob/main/docs/guide.md)
covers comparing, editing, refs between graphs, exporting, checking files
and write locks.

## Data format

    ;; optional, top level: :theme — a built-in (:nord, :dracula, …) or {:base :nord :accent "#b58900"}
    ;;                     :layout — :layered (default), :compact or :tiled (spread big diagrams down as well as across)
    {:nodes {:api {:name "API"           ; display name (defaults to the key)
                   :type "service"       ; free-form; colors the name, shown as (type)
                   :text "Order intake"  ; shown inside the node (boxes too); "\n" or a vector for more lines
                   :lang "clojure"       ; any other attr: inspector panel only
                   :ref "sub/api.edn"    ; another graph file, relative to this one — "follow ref" opens it;
                                         ; the node gets a double border
                   :pair "views/deploy.edn#api-svc" ; the same thing in another graph — "follow pair" jumps to it
                   :md-ref "docs/api.md" ; the markdown doc describing it (node or box) — dotted border; "open md" edits it
                   :state :in-progress}  ; :new | :in-progress | :blocked | :done — a mark on the node's corner
             :web {:type "frontend"}
             :db  {:type "database"}     ; drawn as the database cylinder
             :eo  {:world-model          ; the world a mission plays in, shown in 3D inside the node
                   {:satellites {:s1 {:orbit :leo :inclination 98}}     ; :leo | :meo | :geo
                    :ground-stations {:kiruna {:lat 67.86 :lon 20.96}}}}}
     :edges {[:web :api]                 ; key: endpoints (nodes or boxes), order defines left/right;
                                         ; the same edge cannot appear twice
             {:direction :->             ; :-> | :<- | :<-> | :- (default :-)
              :name "REST"
              :type "http"}}
     :boxes {:backend                    ; key is the box id; :grid [0 0] pins a top-level box to a grid cell
             {:name "Backend"            ; display name (defaults to the key)
              :type "zone"               ; colors the box (separate palette)
              :components #{:api :db}}}} ; node and/or box ids; boxes nest

Identifiers may be keywords or strings. An invalid element is skipped with a
warning banner instead of breaking the render. The
[guide](https://github.com/sstoehrm/simpleviz/blob/main/docs/guide.md#data-format)
has the full rules.

## Claude Code and Codex plugins

This repo is a plugin marketplace. Its skill teaches the agent the graph
format and the CLI, so it can write and serve diagrams for you.

Claude Code:

    /plugin marketplace add sstoehrm/simpleviz
    /plugin install simpleviz@simpleviz

Codex:

    codex plugin marketplace add sstoehrm/simpleviz
    codex plugin add simpleviz@simpleviz
