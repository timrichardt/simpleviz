# Guide

The details the README leaves out. In the page, `?` opens a short version.

## Data format

The README example shows every attribute simpleviz reads.

- Identifiers may be keywords or strings.
- `:name` defaults to the key. `:type` colors a node's name or a box (boxes
  have their own palette), and a type keeps its color across restarts and
  edits. Any other attribute shows only in the inspector.
- `:state` — `:new`, `:in-progress`, `:blocked` or `:done` — puts a mark on
  the node's top-right corner: grey disc, blue half disc, red square, green
  disc with a check. Any other value is an ordinary attribute.
- `:ref` links the element to another graph file (see
  [Following refs](#following-refs)). A node with a ref gets a double border.
- `:md-ref` names a markdown doc that describes a node or box (a spec, an
  ADR, notes), as a path relative to the file, `.md` only. It draws a
  dotted border, and "open md" (`f m`) edits the doc (see
  [Editing docs](#editing-docs)).
- `:world-model` makes a node a world-model node: the earth, satellites and
  ground stations a mission plays in, shown in 3D inside the node (see
  [World model](#world-model)).
- `:pair` links a node or box to the same thing in another graph file
  (see [Pairs](#pairs)). A paired element gets a ⇄ mark.
- `:grid [col row]` or `[col row w h]` puts a top-level box on a grid cell
  (see [Grid layout](#grid-layout)).
- `:theme` at the top level sets the graph's colors (see [Themes](#themes)).
- An edge's key is its endpoints, nodes or boxes, in left/right order.
  Writing both `[:a :b]` and `[:b :a]` warns "same connection". An edge
  between a box and its own content, or a box and itself, is skipped with a
  warning. A name that is both a node and a box resolves to the node.
- The pre-v2 vector forms (`:edges [{:nodes [..] ..}]`,
  `:boxes [{:name ".." ..}]`) still render but can't be edited in the page.

Validation runs server-side with [malli](https://github.com/metosin/malli).
Invalid references, duplicate box memberships and containment cycles skip the
element and explain why in a warning banner. A parse error shows an error
banner and keeps the last good render. Graphs with 500+ nodes open with all
top-level boxes collapsed.

## Themes

A graph file can set its own colors with a top-level `:theme`: either the
name of a built-in theme or a map of changes on top of one.

    {:theme :nord
     :nodes {:api {:type "service"}}}

    {:theme {:base :nord          ; the theme to start from (default :light)
             :bg "#fdf6e3"        ; then any theme key
             :accent "#b58900"}
     :nodes {:api {:type "service"}}}

The file's theme carries into PNG and SVG exports. A comparison shows the
new file's theme.

The theme menu at the top of the page picks your theme for every graph
without `:theme`. It's saved in this browser, not in any file, and
"default" follows the operating system's light or dark setting. A file's
`:theme` wins over it: the menu then shows the file's theme, marked
"(file)", and is disabled; change that theme in the file.

Built-in themes: `light` and `dark` (the two the OS setting picks from),
`print` (white, greys, no box fills), `high-contrast`, `blueprint`, `paper`,
`solarized-light`, `solarized-dark`, `nord`, `dracula`, `carbonfox`,
`one-dark`, `tabak-light` and `tabak-dark`.

| Group | Keys |
|---|---|
| page | `:bg :panel :panel-border :panel-divider :text :text-strong :text-muted :text-dim :hover :hover-plain :accent :on-accent :shadow` |
| canvas | `:node-fill :node-stroke :edge :arrow :sub` (the `(type)` line) `:label` (edge labels) `:btn-fill` (box header button) |
| compare | `:diff-added :diff-modified :diff-removed` |
| `:state` marks | `:state-new :state-in-progress :state-blocked :state-done` |
| type colors | `:node-saturation :node-lightness :box-saturation :box-lightness :neutral-node-lightness :neutral-box-lightness` (0–100), `:box-fill-alpha` (0–1) |

(`:on-accent`: text on accent-colored buttons and hints)

Colors are strings: `#rgb`, `#rgba`, `#rrggbb`, `#rrggbbaa`, or
`rgb()`/`rgba()`/`hsl()`/`hsla()`. Named colors aren't accepted. Each `:type` keeps its hue in every theme: the type-color keys
set only saturation and lightness, and the `neutral` ones the grey of
untyped nodes and boxes. An unknown theme, key or value is skipped with a
warning and the rest of the theme applies. Custom colors get no contrast
check.

## Comparing two versions

A comparison is a graph against a *fork* of itself, named by a suffix:

    simpleviz fork graph.edn next      # graph-next.edn, plus a fork of every file graph.edn refs
    simpleviz graph.edn next           # compare graph.edn (old) → graph-next.edn (new)
    simpleviz promote graph.edn next   # each fork replaces its original

`fork` copies the file, and every file reachable through `:ref`, to
`<name>-<suffix>.<ext>` siblings. Refs inside the copies stay as they are.
`promote` walks the fork's refs and moves every fork it finds over its
original. Forks outside that closure are left alone.

Both files render as one merged diagram. Added elements get a green `+` ring
and modified ones an amber `~` ring (select one for an old → new attribute
list). Removed ones stay visible as red, dashed ghosts. Nodes and boxes match
by key, edges by endpoints; flipping the pair or changing `:direction` counts
as modified. The layout follows the new file, and removed elements keep their
old place. A collapsed box that hides a change shows an amber dot. The legend
at the top counts the changes per status (click a row to step through them)
and has the old|new toggle that picks which file edits go to. Both files
live-reload.

Following a ref opens the referenced file's own comparison. A referenced
file without a fork shows as unchanged, and the first edit to its new side
creates the fork. A fork without an original shows everything as added, and
the first edit to its old side creates the original. The file the server
starts with needs its fork.

Try it: `simpleviz demo` serves this comparison of the bundled examples;
select the API node and press `f r`. Add `--no-open` to print the URL
without opening a browser.

## Editing

The page can edit map-form EDN files. An edit patches the file in place,
keeps comments and formatting outside the changed value, and reaches the page
through the usual live reload. Exported PNGs and SVGs, and pre-v2 vector-form files, are
read-only.

**Inspector.** Click a value or its ✎ to edit it. Scalars edit as text and
collections as EDN. Enter commits, Shift+Enter inserts a line break, Escape
cancels. `×` deletes an attribute and the bottom row adds one. The `id` row
renames a node or box, and its edges and box memberships follow. Setting
`name` also renames, to the id derived from it: lowercased, every run of
characters that can't appear in a keyword (anything but letters, digits and
`*+!_'?<>=./-`) turned into one `-`, with no `-` at either end. So
"Web Server (v2)" becomes `web-server-v2`. If that id is taken, the whole
edit is rejected. A name with no usable characters leaves the id alone.
Edges have no id; change their endpoints from the toolbar.

**Toolbar.** The toolbar at the bottom shows the tools for the current
selection, or "new node" when nothing is selected. Creation prompts derive
the id from the name as above and accept `name::type`, so
`Web Server::frontend` creates `web-server` with type "frontend". Pick modes
wait for a click on the canvas. Every tool has a two-key chord, shown on its
button. Chords work while no text field has focus, and Esc cancels a pending
chord or pick.

| Chord | Selection | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `d d` | any | delete; a node or box also loses its edges and its box membership |
| `e 1` `e 2` `e 3` `e 4` | edge | direction → ← ↔ — |
| `c s` / `c t` | edge | change source / target (click the new endpoint) |
| `a e` | node, box | add edge (click the other endpoint, then name it or leave it empty) |
| `a b` | node / box | add to a box / add a box as member (click it); it leaves the box it was in |
| `a n` | box | add a node as member (click it); it leaves the box it was in |
| `r n` | box | remove node (click a member; it moves to the enclosing box or out) |
| `r b` | node | remove from box (it moves to the enclosing box or out) |
| `n n` | none / node / box | new node / new node connected to the selection / new node inside the box |
| `c n` | box | new node inside the box, as `n n` |
| `n b` | node, box | new box around the selection, in the selection's place |
| `r r` | node, box | rename the id |
| `f r` | node, edge, box | follow the `:ref` |
| `f p` | node, box | follow the pair (with several, pick one in the inspector) |
| `f m` | node, box | open the `:md-ref` doc in the text panel |
| `?` | any | toggle the help panel |

**Layout and undo.** A relayout after an edit starts from the previous
positions, so existing elements stay put and a new node appears next to the
one it connects to. ▦ (top right) runs a fresh layout; it's disabled while the
layout is already fresh. Ctrl+Z or ↶ undoes the last edit, from an undo stack
per file that all viewers share (100 entries).

**Security.** The server binds to loopback only and accepts writes only from
its own `localhost`/`127.0.0.1` origin.

## Grid layout

Give top-level boxes a `:grid` cell and they are placed exactly there:

    :boxes {:frontend {:grid [0 0] :components #{:web}}
            :backend  {:grid [1 0] :components #{:api :auth}}
            :data     {:grid [0 1 2 1] :components #{:db}}}  ; spans 2 columns

- Columns and rows count from 0, up to 99. A column is as wide as its widest box, a
  row as tall as its tallest; boxes sit top-left in their cell. An empty
  column or row still leaves its gap.
- Inside each box the usual layout runs; edges leave a box on the side
  facing their other end.
- Nodes and boxes without a cell go beside the gridded box they have the
  most edges to — left when their edges point into it, else right. What
  reaches no gridded box sits in a strip under the grid.
- Edges between cells run through the gaps at right angles; edges sharing
  a gap get their own lanes.
- Only top-level boxes take a cell. A nested box, a malformed value, or a
  cell another box already has warns and is ignored (the box first by
  sorted name keeps an overlapping cell).

## Editing docs

"Open md" (`f m`) opens the `.md` file an element's `:md-ref` names in a
plain-text panel on the right, wider than the inspector; ⤢ makes it fill
the window and Esc docks it again. The panel stays open while you select
other elements or follow refs.

- Ctrl+S (Cmd+S) or Save writes the file, and so do closing the panel and
  opening another doc. ● marks unsaved changes; closing the browser tab
  with unsaved changes asks first.
- A file that doesn't exist yet opens empty, marked "new file", and is
  created, with its folders, on the first save.
- The panel follows the file on disk: without unsaved changes it shows
  what someone else wrote; with unsaved changes it says "changed on disk"
  — Reload takes the file, Overwrite keeps your text. A save is refused
  while an agent holds the file's lock.
- Same path rules as refs: relative to the graph file, never above the
  served folder. Only `.md` files in UTF-8, up to 1 MiB.

## World model

A node whose `:world-model` is a map describes the world a satellite mission
plays in:

    :nodes {:eo {:name "Earth observation"
                 :world-model {:satellites {:sentinel-2a {:orbit :leo :altitude 786 :inclination 98.6 :raan 30}
                                            :galileo-1   {:orbit :meo :inclination 56 :raan 120}
                                            :relay       {:orbit :geo :lon 9}}
                               :ground-stations {:kiruna {:name "Kiruna" :lat 67.86 :lon 20.96
                                                          :min-elevation 5}}}}}

The node is drawn larger, with the setting in 3D under its name: the earth
in the middle, each satellite on its orbit, the ground stations on the
surface, and a dashed line wherever a station sees a satellite. Drag the
globe to turn it (the diagram doesn't pan). The bar at the bottom runs or
pauses the clock (▶/❚❚, one clock for every world-model node), sets its speed,
zooms the globe (− +) and resets view and clock (⟲); it shows the time and
how many contacts there are. Exports draw the globe as it is on screen.

Selected, the node lists its satellites and ground stations in the
inspector; in an editable file, × removes one and the row under each list
adds one. Each change rewrites only that entry of the file.

Satellites, keyed by id like nodes:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `:orbit` | from `:altitude`, else `:leo` | `:leo`, `:meo` or `:geo` |
| `:altitude` | LEO 550, MEO 20200, GEO 35786 | km above the surface |
| `:inclination` | LEO 53, MEO 55, GEO 0 | degrees, 0–180 |
| `:raan` | 0 | right ascension of the ascending node, degrees |
| `:phase` | 0 | where on its orbit it starts, degrees from the ascending node |
| `:lon` | — | GEO only: the longitude it stays over (replaces `:raan`/`:phase`) |
| `:name` | the id | label |

Ground stations need `:lat` and `:lon` (degrees); `:min-elevation` (default
10°) is how high above the horizon a satellite must be to be in contact, and
`:name` labels it. A new satellite added in the panel gets its class's
defaults, with its `:raan` (a GEO satellite's `:lon`) 45° from the last one of
its class, so they don't overlap.

Orbits are ideal circles and the clock starts at T+0 with longitude 0
facing the x axis — an illustration of the setting, not an ephemeris. An
entry with a bad value is left out and the panel says why.

## Following refs

A `:ref` on a node, box or edge names another graph file by a path relative
to the file it's in. With the element selected, "follow ref" (`f r`) opens
that graph in place. The trail at the top leads back, and so does the
browser's back button.

- Refs may use `..` but can't leave the folder of the file the server
  started with. They must point at an `.edn` file or an exported `.png` or
  `.svg`.
- Following a ref to a missing `.edn` file creates it as an empty graph,
  folders included. In a comparison, only the side picked by the old|new
  toggle is created.
- A ref names the original, never a fork: `x-next.edn` is refused while
  comparing with `next`.
- A graph served from a PNG or SVG can't follow refs.

In `examples/demo.edn` the API node refs `api/internals.edn`, whose
"Demo overview" node refs back.

## Pairs

A `:pair` on a node or box names the same thing in another graph file:
`"views/deploy.edn#api-svc"`, a path relative to the file the pair is in,
`#`, and a node or box id there. Several views take a vector of them.
The path follows the ref rules: `..` is fine, the served folder is the
limit, and a fork is refused.

- The ⇄ mark shows elements with pairs; a red ⇄ marks one with a broken
  pair. The inspector lists them: `→` for
  pairs declared here, `←` for pairs in other files that point here, so
  declaring one side is enough. Click one, or use "follow pair" (`f p`),
  to open that graph with the element selected; the trail leads back.
- The server finds pairs pointing here by reading every `.edn` under the
  served root's folder, except dot-folders, `node_modules` and forks. A
  pair added in another file shows once this file reloads.
- A broken pair (missing file, missing id, a fork, a path out of the
  folder) is dimmed in the inspector and warns in the banner, in
  `simpleviz check` and in `/api/errors`. `check` treats the checked
  file's folder as the served folder and only checks pairs the file
  declares.
- Following a pair never creates a file. When the id is gone, the file
  still opens, with a banner naming what's missing.
- If both a node and a box have the id, the pair means the node.

## Exporting

⇩ (top right) opens the export menu. PNG downloads the whole graph as an
image, SVG as a vector drawing, which scales without blurring and keeps its
text as text. Both embed the source EDN (the SVG in its `<metadata>`); an
export made in compare mode embeds both files.

    simpleviz extract diagram.png            # print the embedded EDN (compare export: the new file)
    simpleviz extract diagram.png --old      # compare export: the old file
    simpleviz extract diagram.svg graph.edn  # write it to a file (never overwrites)

An exported PNG or SVG works anywhere an EDN file does, read-only:

    simpleviz diagram.png                    # serve the embedded graph
    simpleviz diagram.svg next               # compare against diagram-next.svg
    simpleviz compare-export.png             # reopen the full comparison

SVG fonts are referenced, not embedded. Browsers show the SVG exactly like the
page; other tools such as Inkscape may substitute a font, so label widths can
differ slightly from their boxes.

### From the terminal

`simpleviz export` writes the same file ⇩ downloads, without opening a window:
the page renders it in a headless Chrome or Chromium.

    simpleviz export graph.edn graph.png               # PNG of graph.edn
    simpleviz export graph.edn next diff.svg           # compare export, both files embedded
    simpleviz export diagram.png diagram.svg           # re-export an export
    simpleviz export graph.edn graph.png --theme nord  # pick the theme

- The format follows the output's extension, `.png` or `.svg`. An existing
  output is kept unless you pass `--force`.
- Every box is expanded, even in a big graph that the page opens collapsed.
- The theme is the file's `:theme`. A file without one gets `--theme`, else
  light. The page's theme menu doesn't apply here.
- simpleviz looks for `google-chrome`, `chromium`, `microsoft-edge` or
  `brave-browser` on your PATH, then for the macOS apps. Set
  `SIMPLEVIZ_BROWSER` to a path or command to pick one.
- A snap browser keeps its temporary profile in `~/snap/<name>/common/`,
  since a snap can't use the system's temp folder. simpleviz deletes it
  when it's done.

## Checking a file

The page shows a file's problems in banners. To get the same report
without a browser, for example from a script or an agent:

    simpleviz check graph.edn                           # works without a server
    curl -s http://localhost:7373/api/errors            # the served file
    curl -s 'http://localhost:7373/api/errors?file=sub/api.edn'

`check` prints `error: ..` or one `warning: ..` line per warning and exits
1, or prints `ok`. The route answers `{"error":null,"warnings":[]}` for a
clean file. In compare mode `file` names the original, not the fork; the
report covers both sides, and each warning starts with its file's name.

## Write locks

Agents and scripts that write a served file directly can coordinate through
an advisory lock per file:

    curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"owner":"agent-a","path":"sub/api.edn"}' http://localhost:7373/api/lock
    curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"owner":"agent-a","path":"sub/api.edn"}' http://localhost:7373/api/unlock

`path` is the file's name relative to the served folder (a fork is
`graph-next.edn`) and defaults to the root file. `/api/lock` answers
`{"ok":true,"ttl":60}`, or 409 `{"error":"locked by <owner>"}` while someone
else holds the lock. Locking again as the same owner renews the 60 seconds;
after that a forgotten lock expires. The page's edits to a locked file are
refused with the same message. Nothing stops a process that writes without
asking.

## Updating the agent plugins

Claude Code updates marketplace plugins in the background. To update by hand,
say right after a release:

    /plugin marketplace update simpleviz
    claude plugin update simpleviz@simpleviz

Codex: refresh the marketplace, then add the plugin again (a clean
reinstall):

    codex plugin marketplace upgrade
    codex plugin add simpleviz@simpleviz
